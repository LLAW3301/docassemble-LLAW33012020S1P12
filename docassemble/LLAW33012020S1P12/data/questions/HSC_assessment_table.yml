question: Client's Overall Score 
subquestion: |
   The following table lists out the client's overall score for each domain and the total overall score of the WHODAS Assessment. 
   
   In assessing whether the client may be eligible for the NDIS, the threshold score for the WHODAS Assessment is {50%}. This means that the client has a higher possibility to access the NDIS if they have acquired an overall score of **50% or more** for the WHODAS Assessment. 

   Subsequently, the client may also be eligible for the NDIS if a particular domain has an {average score of 3}. 
   
   **Note: The NDIA will make the final decision.**
